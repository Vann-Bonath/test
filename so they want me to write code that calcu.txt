so they want me to write code that calculate sum of romance num

break down problem 

loop throught each later
convert string into romance number
convert romance
compair number if number infront is smaller then next number just substract them and make it comeout possitive

psuedo code

array of string = s.split("")
convert["I"]
sum
if convert1 < convert2

result = |convert - convert 2|
sum = sum + result
